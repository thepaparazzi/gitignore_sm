gitignore_sm
=======

Provides the `.gitignore` file for the root of a StepMania 3.95 or OpenITG
directory that is also the root of a git repository.

The ignore patterns are intended to ignore directories and files that are
scarcely changed (popular, long-running packs of song files) or should be
considered read-only (default themes and noteskins). This allows the user to
create a clean monolithic repository for their own song packs or courses under
development without pulling others' work into git.
